**Title**: The effect of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions on household health expenditures

**Abstract**: In this paper, I investigate the effect of expanding Medicaid coverage on health expenditures among households headed by a nonelderly adult aged 18-64 years. Using household level health expenditure data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) for the years 2010-2016, I estimate a difference-in-differences model to compare states that did and did not adopt the Medicaid expansion. The main results show that the Medicaid expansions caused a significant decrease in overall health expenditures of $16.44 per month per household, driven by a decrease in medical service expenditures of $18.01 per month per household. There was no significant change in spending on health insurance, prescription drugs, or medical supplies. Further research is required to determine the mechanism of this decrease in medical service expenditures following an increase in insurance coverage.
